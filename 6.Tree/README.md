## Properties

1. The maximum no of node at level "l" in binary tree are 2^l
2. The maximum no of nodes in binary tree of height "h" = 2^h - 1
3. In binary tree of nodes N, the minimum possible height or minimum possible level is = log(N + 1) (base2)
4. A binary tree with atleast "L" leaves has atleast | LogL (base2) | + 1
5. In a binary tree where every node has 0 to 2 children, the no of leaf node are always one more than node with two child

## Types of Binary tree

#### 1. Full Binary Tree

The binary tree is full  binary tree if every node has two child

#### 2. Complete Binary Tree

The binary tree is complete binary tree if all the levels are completely filled excepet the of last level but last level has all left node possible

#### 3. Perfect Binary tree

The binary tree is perfect binary tree if all the internal node have 2 children and all the leaf nodes at the same level
